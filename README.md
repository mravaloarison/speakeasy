## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v14.x.x or later)
* Python (v3.x.x or later)
* OpenAI API key

### Usage
The application consists of three main features:

* **Email Generation**: Enter a prompt for an email and the application will generate a complete email for you.

* **Phrase Rewording**: Enter a phrase and the application will offer different ways to reword it.

* **Language Translation**: Enter text in one language and the application will translate it into another language.

### Built with
* [React](https://react.dev/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) - React UI framework
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) - Python web framework
* [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis) - GPT-3 API
